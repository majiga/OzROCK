The metadolerite dykes are only 1-3 m wide. They parallel numerous Archean metadolerite dykes (A-mwa-YNA); however, the garnet-bearing metadolerite dykes are inferred to be Paleoproterozoic in age since they crosscut Archean-aged fabrics and are themselves intruded by granitic rocks of the 1820-1775 Ma Moorarie Supersuite. The metadolerite dykes are distinguished from Archean amphibolites (A-mwa-YNA) in that they commonly contain corona textures of garnet around pyroxene, and do not contain a well-developed gneissic banding or schistosity.

Unexposed gabbro and gabbronorite identified by a distinct, north-northeasterly trending belt of remanently magnetized intrusions within the east Albany-Fraser Orogen that were intersected in exploration drillcores. The age of the gabbro is unknown, and it intrudes metasedimentary rocks of unknown age. Originally informally named the Salt Creek Complex by Mithril Resources Limited (2003, 2005) who identified it in drillcores. Gabbroic bodies range from 2-12km in diameter. Appears to intrude the Northern Foreland, Tropicana and Biranup Zones based on magnetic images where magnetic lows are coincident with drilled gabbroic rocks. May be part of the Gnowangerup-Fraser Dyke Suite or represent a younger event.","Quartz diorite gabbro, gabbro, oligoclase-labradorite-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene-biotite-magnetite-quartz gabbro and plagioclase-clinopyroxene-bitoite-ilmenite-magnetite-apatite gabbro.",igneous mafic intrusive,,,Y,

(1999). There are at least three thick couplets of evaporitic dolomite overlain by mixed sandy and silty siliciclastic rocks. The Scorpion Group was deposited in a northward-deepening coastal setting, sourced from adjacent areas to the south. The pattern of outcrop suggests that there is a major evaporitic diapir (now collapsed because of salt solution and withdrawal) in the central part of the graben occupied by the group. Formations have not been established within the group, although this would be possible with further work. The Scorpion Group is a probable correlative (based on tentative stromatolite biostratigraphy, Grey, K., GSWA, 2000, pers. comm.) of the lower parts of the latest Palaeoproterozoic - early Mesoproterozoic Edmund Group, the lowermost component of the Bangemall Basin that is exposed about 200 km to the west (Fig. 3; Martin et al., 1999).
